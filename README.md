# XML-Parser
Probably a horrendous way to make one, but will turn any valid xml file into a list that can be iterated through
# This probably isn't the best way to do it
What can I say? I'm still kind of a noob. But we learn by making mistake, so I will keep coding until I make less
# It doesn't check for correct XML files
Not at all, not a single lick of improper file format detection (for now)
# And finally, it's in Java
And that might be the greatest sin of all to some people, but hang me if you will, I want cross-platform abilities with a generally high level syntax. Sue me.
